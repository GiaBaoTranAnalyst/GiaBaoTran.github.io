									</summary>
									<dd>
										<p>
											I am a Business Analytics postgraduate student with over a year of professional experience in the eCommerce
											 and Internet Services Industry. </p>
										<p>
											My journey began in 2022, delving into Python and initiating simple data 
											 exploration projects. As time progressed, I expanded my expertise. In the latter half of 2023, I delved into 
											 Machine Learning and Deep Learning, leveraging Python libraries such as SciKitLearn, Keras, and TensorFlow 
											 to develop predictive models. Concurrently, I enrolled in an Analytics postgraduate program, 
											 acquiring proficiency in Big Data tools like Apache Hadoop with Hive and Pig for web scraping, 
											 and mastering Business Intelligence tools like Tableau, Power BI, and IBM Cognos. Currently, 
											 I am employed as a Customer Intelligence Researcher at Tucows, where I am cultivating a robust foundation 
											 in data analytics and reporting. </p>
											 Over the past year, my proficiency and interest in Business Intelligence 
											 tools have grown significantly. I am adept at using Tableau and Power BI within the Python and SQL 
											 environment, along with Google Cloud Platform. With a solid grasp of Mathematics and Statistics, 
											 I excel in working with large and intricate datasets. My overarching goal in data analytics, visualization, 
											 and reporting is to facilitate decision-making for others. Crafting solutions that stakeholders can utilize 
											 to streamline their decision-making processes and adopt a data-driven approach brings me immense 
											 satisfaction.
